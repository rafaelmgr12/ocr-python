## ‚ú® Technology

The Project was develop as using the following techs:
- [Fast API](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- [Pytesseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/)


## üíª Project

This project was developed as part of the "[Build a REST API Using Python and Deploy it to Microsoft Azure](https://www.educative.io/courses/rest-api-python-microsoft-azure)" course on [Educative](https://www.educative.io/). The goal of the project is to create an API using the FastAPI framework, which can simultaneously extract text from images uploaded by users. Using FastAPI allowed us to build a performant and scalable API with minimal boilerplate code.

One of the key features of our API is its ability to extract text from images. By leveraging third-party libraries and machine learning models, we were able to build a robust OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system that can accurately recognize text from a wide variety of image formats.

Overall, this project was an excellent learning opportunity that helped us develop our Python programming skills, as well as gain experience with deploying applications on a cloud platform.

###  üìì Requirements 
As educational project, and the purpose is use the concepts of CRUD, then we requirements of the our applications is to : 

1. Post one or more Images to Extract from images


### End Points
The API has the following end points:

| Type       | url               | Functionality                                |
| ---------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| ```post``` | "/api/v1/extract_text"      | Post one or more Images                              |
